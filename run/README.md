This folder contains the scripts and code used to generate the diagrams.

The following dependencies are required by the image generation script:

 - Circos (the version included in the third-party folder)
 - the Circos tableviewer tool (included in the third-party folder)
 - the Perl interpreter
 - the Perl modules required by Circos and tableviewer:

    - Config::General (v2.50 or later)
    - Font::TTF
    - GD
    - List::MoreUtils
    - Math::Bezier
    - Math::Round
    - Math::VecStat
    - Params::Validate
    - Readonly
    - Regexp::Common
    - Set::IntSpan (v1.16 or later)
    - Text::Format
    - Statistics::Descriptive

The script also relies on the following image processing libraries, used to generate the diagrams in various file formats.

 - ImageMagick
 - Inkscape
 - librsvg
 - epstopdf (part of a LaTeX distribution)

Those dependencies can be lifted if the correpsonding lines are commented out in the generate_diagrams.bash script.

The script can be run as follows (note that it has to be run from within the run/ folder!):

    $ ./generate.bash <data_file>

    <data_file> is the path to a data file generated by the Python script in the src/ folder. A selection of ready-to-use data files is available in the output/ folder.
